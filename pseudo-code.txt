Summary: Make a game that runs in the console. The computer will play against the user.
Computer will randomly pick a choice between Rock, Paper and Scissors. Will ask user for a
choice that isn't case sensitive. Rock beats scissors which beats paper which beats rock.

#function getCompChoice:
    List = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
    random.int(0, 2)
    return list[random.int]

#function getPlayerChoice:
    input = "What is your choice? (rock, paper, or scissors)
    input.tolowercase
    return input

#function playRound(playerChoice, compChoice):
    let playerwon = false
    if (playerchoice == "rock"):
        if (compChoice == "scissors"):
            console.log("Player has won!")
            playerwon = true
        else if (compChoice == "rock"):
            console.log("It is a tie!")
        else if (compChoice == "paper"):
            console.log("Computer has won!")
    else if (playerchoice == "paper"):
        if (compChoice == "scissors"):
            console.log("Computer has won!")
        else if (compChoice == "rock"):

        else if (compChoice == "paper"):
            console.log("It is a tie!")
    else
        if (compChoice == "scissors"):
            console.log("It is a tie!")
        else if (compChoice == "rock"):

    prompt how many games you want to play?
    for x in range gamecount:
        choice = prompt(What your choice?)
        compChoice = randcomp()
